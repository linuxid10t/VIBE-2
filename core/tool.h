/* tool.h - tool registry and dispatch. C89.
 *
 * A tool is a struct of function pointers rather than a class, which keeps the
 * whole thing compilable by a 1993 C compiler and makes the registry a plain
 * array.
 *
 * tool_execute() is the only entry point, and it does three things no caller
 * should have to remember: resolve the gate resource, consult the permission
 * gate, and guarantee a well-formed tool_result even when the tool misbehaves.
