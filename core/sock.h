/* sock.h - TCP client sockets, and the loop_net that sits on top. C89.
 *
 * One implementation covers POSIX and OS/2. That is deliberate: the two
 * platforms differ in about six places, and isolating those behind macros
 * means the code path the host tests exercise is the code path that ships,
 * rather than an OS/2 twin that nobody has ever run.
 *
 * The six differences, all at the top of sock.c:
 *
 *   1. sock_init() must be called once before anything else on OS/2.
 *   2. Socket handles are NOT file descriptors there: read/write/close do not
 *      work on them. Use recv/send and soclose().
 *   3. errno is not set; the error code comes from sock_errno().
 *   4. select() takes an entirely different argument list.
 *   5. There is no getaddrinfo, so name resolution goes through
 *      gethostbyname() -- which is also used on POSIX, on purpose, so both
 *      platforms run the same resolution code. IPv4 only; OS/2's stack is
 *      IPv4 anyway.
 *   6. Link tcpip32.lib, and the machine needs the 32-bit stack
 *      (so32dll.dll / tcp32dll.dll), not Warp 3's original 16-bit IAK.
 *
 * gethostbyname() is not re-entrant. Only the engine worker thread may call
 * into this file; the UI thread must not.
