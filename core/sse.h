/* sse.h - Server-Sent Events stream parser.
 *
 * C89. Depends on buf.h.
 *
 * THE POINT OF THIS FILE: all parse state lives in sse_parser and survives
 * across sse_feed() calls. A single SSE event routinely straddles two or more
 * network reads once tool-call arguments get large, and holding the partial
 * line in a local variable silently truncates the event -- which shows up much
 * later as unparseable tool input rather than as a network error. Keep the
 * state here; never reconstruct it per read.
 *
 * Handles CRLF, LF and bare-CR line endings, including a CRLF pair split
 * across a chunk boundary.
 *
 * Usage:
 *     sse_parser p;
 *     sse_init(&p, on_event, ctx);
 *     while ((n = read(...)) > 0)
 *         sse_feed(&p, buffer, n);
 *     sse_finish(&p);          
 *     sse_free(&p);
