/* loop.h - the agentic loop. C89.
 *
 * One step is: build a request from the stored conversation, stream the
 * response, persist it, run any tool calls, persist their results. Repeat
 * while the model keeps asking for tools, up to cfg->max_steps.
 *
 * The loop owns no I/O of its own. Transport comes in through loop_net, which
 * the OS/2 build fills with sock.c and the tests fill with a fake, so every
 * decision in here is exercised on the host.
 *
 * The system prompt is injected at request time rather than stored as the
 * first message. Editing a config file then changes the prompt for existing
 * sessions, which is what a user expects, and history stays a pure record of
 * the conversation.
